# Exercise 2: Writing Your First Unity Script
## Clone your repository
1. - [ ] Clone the existing Exercise2 repository you created via GitHub Classroom.
2. - [ ] Use Unity Hub to create a new 2D Unity project named Exercise2 *inside* the repository you just cloned.  Be sure to set the location for the project as the new Repo folder.  
3. - [ ] Once the project opens in Unity, go to File Explorer and Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file up into your **Unity project** folder and rename to **.gitignore**
4. - [ ] In GitHub Desktop, click commit. Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files).

## Problem - Output your favorite three games
1. - [ ] Change the name of SampleScene to Scene0.
2. - [ ] Add a Scripts folder and add a new C# script named PrintFavoriteGames.
3. - [ ] Open the script, fill in the comment near the top of the script, and delete the Update method.
4. - [ ] Next, add code to the Start method to output the names of your three favorite games.
5. - [ ] Attach the script to the Main Camera in the scene and run the game to see the output in the Console window.

Commit your changes and push to GitHub.
_**Caution:**_ Don't try to use **Console.WriteLine()**  your Unity scripts to print to the Console window; you should use **Debug.Log**
